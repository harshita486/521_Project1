Description:
This project includes two main components designed to clean comments from C program files. The first component is a PHP script that removes valid comments and identifies invalid comments within C program files. The second is an HTML file with embedded JavaScript, designed for use in a web browser, which prompts the user for a C program as input, removes valid comments, and alerts the user to any invalid comments detected.

Prerequisites:
To run the PHP script, you will need:
•	PHP 7.4 or higher installed on your system.
To view and interact with the HTML file, you will need:
•	Any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

Installation:
No installation is required for the HTML component. Simply download the HTML file and open it in your web browser.

For the PHP script:
1.	Ensure PHP is installed on your system. You can verify by running php -v in your command line or terminal.
2.	Download the project.php file to your local machine.


Usage:
Running the PHP Script
1.	Open a terminal or command line interface.
2.	Navigate to the directory containing the project.php file.
3.	Run the script by executing:

php removeComments.php 

4.	When prompted, enter the path to your C program file. The script will process the file and output the result in the terminal.

Using the HTML File:
1.	Open the project.html file in any modern web browser.
2.	A prompt will appear asking you to enter your C program code. Enter the code directly into the prompt box.
3.	After processing, an alert will show the cleaned code or any error messages related to invalid comments.
